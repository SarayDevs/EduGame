# EduGame
This Educational Software makes learning fractions fun for children. Developed in Godot Engine (which uses a Python-like language) by a team of three. My role was coding functionality, bug testing, and designing elements like the menu wallpaper and sound effects. I used Canva and Aseprite for designs
